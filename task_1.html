            <h3>The Lightest Diamond Rated Lock!</h3>
            <p>The Seatylock Mason U-lock is a Sold Secure Diamond lock that gives your bicycle security at a
                great
                price point and unbelievable weight. Buy it directly from Seatylock (free shipping), and grab
                the
                mount too if you want to secure it to your bike like I did. It also comes in larger sizes than
                the
                one I reviewed.</p>

            <h4 id="what-like">What I Like about the Seatylock Mason U-lock</h4>
            <p>
                It’s these traits that set apart the <a href="https://bit.ly/45ynLFc">Seatylock Mason</a>
                as a great lock that’s fun and easy to use. Convenience is key, and this is one
                convenient
                lock.

            <h4 id="what-dont-like">What I don’t Like</h4>
            <p>I honestly couldn’t find much bad about this lock. There are a few things that could be annoying
                depending on what you’re looking for, but in general they can also be seen as good traits.</p>

            <h4 id="mounting">Mounting the Lock on your Bike</h4>
            <p>The best way to hold your lock while you’re riding is to mount it somewhere on the frame.
                You can see in my video review that I have it mounted on my headtube right under the handlebars, but
                you can put it anywhere it fits really!</p>

            <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
            <figure>

            <p>This Seatylock Mason Ulock is one of my new favorite locks, and after using it for a few years I’m
                quite satisfied with it. I like it more than the similar Abus & Kryptonite locks because of the few
                extra features it has. Let me know in the comments your thoughts on this lock if you have it.</p>
